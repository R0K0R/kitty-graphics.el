;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Display images in terminal Emacs (emacs -nw) using the Kitty graphics
;; protocol with direct placements.
;;
;; Architecture: image data is transmitted once per terminal via `a=t'
;; (stored in the terminal without display).  Overlays reserve blank space
;; in Emacs buffers.  After each redisplay, direct placements (`a=p' with
;; cursor positioning) are emitted via `send-string-to-terminal' at the
;; correct screen positions.  Each placement uses a unique placement ID
;; (`p=PID') so repeated placements replace rather than accumulate.
;;
;; Multiple terminals (emacs --daemon + several `emacsclient -t'): output
;; is routed per window to that window's own terminal, and per-client state
;; (backend, cell size, text-sizing level, and which image ids have been
;; transmitted) lives in terminal parameters, so clients on different
;; terminals - even mixed Kitty and Sixel - render correctly at once.
;; Capability probes run lazily, once per terminal, while it is selected.
;; Inline video (mpv) and the casty browser stream a single byte stream to
;; one fd and are therefore bound to the terminal they were launched on;
;; the same buffer shown on a second client renders only its reserved
;; blank area there.
;;
;; Requires: Kitty >= 0.20.0 (direct placement support).
;; Important: Launch Emacs with TERM=xterm-256color for proper color support.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'kitty-graphics)
;;   (kitty-graphics-setup)
;;   ;; Then org-mode C-c C-x C-v, markdown-mode `markdown-toggle-inline-images',
;;   ;; image-mode, eww images all work.
;;
;; `kitty-graphics-setup' enables the mode the right way for both plain
;; `emacs -nw' and `emacs --daemon': under a daemon there is no terminal
;; at startup, so it defers enabling to the first `emacsclient -t' frame.
;; For a one-off interactive terminal you can also just call
;; `kitty-graphics-mode' directly.
